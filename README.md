# Animheros
Video Game developed on GameMaker studio for the Epitech Jam, an event over a weekend whose objective is to develop something around a theme which this time was superheroes

## The Game
The game is a survivor where you play a poacher (you are the bad guy) and you try to kill as many animals as possible, but sometimes, the PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) sends its best agent, a guy disguised as a batman trying to stop you. The only end of the game is when you die because poaching is wrong.
